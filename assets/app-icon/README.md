# Papel app icon

**Figure:** Aldus Manutius. He created the pocket book, the first portable document.

**Style:** a black-and-white portrait cut out over a full-bleed colour field, head and shoulders, in
the Nodalia icon family (one historical figure per app, one colour per app).

**Tile:** 512 × 512 viewBox, rounded square `rx=112`, clipped; no border or roundel.

**Provenance:** the portrait is "Aldus Manutius.png" from
[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aldus_Manutius.png) (public domain). The figure was separated from its
background, converted to black and white and placed over the app colour.

**Linux:** the hicolor icons (`hicolor/scalable` and every PNG size) put the tile on the Nodalix
app grid, like the Colloid icons around it: a 224 px tile inside a 256 px canvas (16 px margin),
a 51.5 px corner radius and a soft shadow. The scalable SVG is made by `tools/nodalia-app-icon.py`
in [nodalix-icon-theme](https://github.com/danielmigueltejedor/nodalix-icon-theme) and
`packaging/icons.sh` renders the PNG sizes from it. macOS, the Windows `.ico` and the
1024 px render keep the full-bleed tile. The window and taskbar icon on Windows is the 256 px
hicolor PNG, so it has the Linux margin and shadow.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `pdfcraft.svg` | master: the portrait as a 1024 px image embedded in an SVG with the tile clip (canonical) |
| `pdfcraft-small.svg` | lighter 512 px version; also the web favicon where there is one |
| `pdfcraft-1024.png` | 1024 px on Apple's grid; also the runtime Dock icon on macOS |
| `pdfcraft.icns` | macOS icon (16–1024 px) |
| `pdfcraft.ico` | Windows icon (16–256 px), embedded in `pdfcraft.exe` by `apps/pdfcraft/build.rs` |
| `pdfcraft-document.svg` | Windows PDF file icon master: a Lucide document outline, red badge and outlined PDF lettering; no font dependency |
| `pdfcraft-document.ico` | Windows PDF file icon (16–256 px), embedded as resource 2 in `pdfcraft.exe` |
| `hicolor/<n>x<n>/apps/ai.storyteller.pdfcraft.png` | Linux hicolor theme, 16–512 px; the 256 px one is the runtime icon on Windows and Linux |
| `hicolor/scalable/apps/ai.storyteller.pdfcraft.svg` | Linux scalable icon (Nodalix app grid) |

Where it shows: `apps/pdfcraft/src/main.rs` sets the window icon (Dock, taskbar, Alt-Tab, launcher) and the
Wayland app id `ai.storyteller.pdfcraft`; `packaging/linux/ai.storyteller.pdfcraft.desktop` names the
hicolor icon.

Windows PDF files use resource 2 (`"pdfcraft.exe",-2`) when Papel is chosen as the default
reader; the app keeps resource 1. The document outline is adapted from Lucide `file-text`
1.49.0 (ISC); its badge and outlined lettering are original (`MIT OR Apache-2.0`), covered by
[LICENSE-document.txt](LICENSE-document.txt). Both icons are embedded, requiring no runtime
sidecar. This provides a file type icon; first-page thumbnails still need a thumbnail provider.

## Regenerate

The icon is a raster portrait, so the SVG files embed an image instead of traced paths. The
derived files in this directory were rendered directly from the portrait. `packaging/icons.sh`
still works on `pdfcraft.svg` (resvg renders embedded images), but its output will differ slightly
from the committed files in resampling.
